I was required to learn a large degree of legal, marketing, estimation, scheduling, accounting, efficiency, customer relations and many more skills in order to achieve and maintain success. With regards to software, college forced my hand to independently learn many languages quickly, as well as various topics such as algorithms, hardware, software development, web, databases, theory etc. Regardless of the topics, I'm able to quickly pick up a new skill and excel at it."

Leveraged exceptional interpersonal skills from running my company through delivery of highly respected customer service and satisfaction. As a result, received consistent positive feedback and built a reputation for effective communication and collaboration.
